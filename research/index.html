<p> My current research has two major branches: 
<ol>
  <li> learning energy functions of high-dimensional data </li> 
  <li> mapping the macroscopic structures of high-dimensional energy functions </li>
</ol>

<h2> Learning Energy Functions of High-Dimensional Data </h2>

<h2> Mapping Mascropic Structures of High-Dimensional Energy Functions </h2>
