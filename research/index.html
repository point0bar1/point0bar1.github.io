<h1> Research </h1>

<p> My current research has two major branches: 
<ol>
  <li> learning energy functions of high-dimensional data </li> 
  <li> mapping the macroscopic structures of high-dimensional energy functions </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2> Learning Energy Functions of High-Dimensional Data </h2>

<p>
  An energy function is the term $U(x)$ of a Gibbs density $p(x) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp\{ - U (x) \} $. The energy function defines a physical system over the state space of $x$ that determines the distribution of states. In my work, the states $x$ are images and the function $U(x)$ is a Convolutional Neural Network.
