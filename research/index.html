  My current research has two major branches: 
</p>

<h2>1. Learning ConvNet Energy Functions of High-Dimensional Image Data</h2>

  Energy-based learning with ConvNet functions exhibits surprising behaviors not encountered for earlier energy functions.
  Two distinct of outcomes are possible: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.12370.pdf">convergent learning and non-convergent learning</a>. 
  <br/><br/>
  Convergent learning is consistent with conventional theoretical expectations but is difficult to achieve in practice.
  Learning convergent energy functions with realistic long-run MCMC samples is essential for energy landscape mapping applications.
  My research introduces the first ConvNet energy functions with realistic long-run MCMC samples in the image space.  
  <br/><br/>
  Non-convergent learning is an unexpected phenomenon that occurs for ConvNet energy functions which is explored <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09770.pdf">here</a>.
  Informative initialization methods for MCMC sampling such as Contrastive Divergence and Persistent Contrastive Divergence are not needed for stable learning and high-quality short-run synthesis.
  By initializing MCMC samples from noise images rather than a data image or persistent image, one can learn a non-convergent energy function that can generate realistic images from noise like a generator or flow model.

<h2>2. Mapping Macroscopic Structures of Non-Convex Energy Functions</h2>

<p>
  The local modes of an energy function are stable states that appear with high probability.
  An energy function defines a non-Euclidean geometry over the state space. 
  Geodesic distances along the energy manifold provide a measure of conceptual similarity between states.
  Related groups of local modes form macroscopic non-convex structures that are analagous to folding funnels of protein potentials.
  I use a novel MCMC algorithm to detect metastable structures of learned energy functions that correspond to intuitive image concepts, as explored <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01043.pdf">here</a>.
