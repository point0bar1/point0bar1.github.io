<h1> Research </h1>

<p> 
  An energy function defines a physical system over a state space that determines the distribution of states. 
  In my work, the states are images and the energy function is a ConvNet. 
  My current research has two major branches: 
</p>

<h2> Learning Energy Functions of High-Dimensional Data </h2>

<p>
  Energy-based learning with ConvNet functions exhibits surprising behaviors not encountered for earlier energy functions.
  My research identifies two major families of outcomes: convergent learning and non-convergent learning.
</p>

<h2> Mapping Mascropic Structures of High-Dimensional Energy Functions </h2>

<p>
  The local modes of an energy function are stable states that appear with high probability. 
  Related groups of local modes form macroscopic non-convex structures that are analagous to folding funnels of protein potentials.
  My work uses a novel MCMC algorithm to detect metastable structures of learned energy functions that correspond to intuitive image concepts.
