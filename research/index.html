  My current research has two major branches: 
</p>

<h2>1. Learning ConvNet Energy Functions of High-Dimensional Image Data</h2>

<p>
  Energy-based learning with ConvNet functions exhibits surprising behaviors not encountered for earlier energy functions.
  Two distinct of outcomes are possible: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12370">convergent learning and non-convergent learning</a>. 
  Convergent learning is consistent with conventional theoretical expectations but is difficult to achieve in practice.
  Non-convergent learning is an unexpected phenomenon that occurs for ConvNet energy functions which is explored <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09770">here</a>.

<h2>2. Mapping Macroscopic Structures of Non-Convex Energy Functions</h2>

<p>
  The local modes of an energy function are stable states that appear with high probability. 
  Related groups of local modes form macroscopic non-convex structures that are analagous to folding funnels of protein potentials.
  I use a novel MCMC algorithm to detect metastable structures of learned energy functions that correspond to intuitive image concepts, as explored <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01043">here</a>.
