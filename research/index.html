<h1>Research</h1>

<p> 
  My current research has two major branches: 
</p>

<h2>1. Learning Energy Functions of High-Dimensional Image Data</h2>

<p>
  Energy-based learning with ConvNet functions exhibits surprising behaviors not encountered for earlier energy functions.
  My research identifies two types outcomes: convergent learning and non-convergent learning. 
  Convergent learning is consistent with conventional expectations but is very difficult to achieve.
  Non-convergent learning is an unexpected phenomenon that occurs for ConvNet energy functions.
</p>

<h2>2. Mapping Macroscopic Structures of Non-Convex Energy Functions</h2>

<p>

  The local modes of an energy function are stable states that appear with high probability. 
  Related groups of local modes form macroscopic non-convex structures that are analagous to folding funnels of protein potentials.
  My work uses a novel MCMC algorithm to detect metastable structures of learned energy functions that correspond to intuitive image concepts.
